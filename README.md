# Docker, React and Django Initial Setup

## How to Run
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## How it Works
Django will run on localhost:8000 as a standalone API <br>
React will run on localhost:3000 as a standalone SPA

### Also Check Out the Second Setup
React builds static js and gives it to django. So it runs inside django as an app. <br>
